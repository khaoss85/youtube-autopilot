- Detailed sub-agent descriptions
- Routing guide (which sub-agent for which task)
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Architecture rules and best practices

## Why Use Sub-Agents?

- **40-60% faster development** - Focused context (1,500 LOC vs 12,300 LOC)
- **Better code quality** - Each sub-agent enforces domain best practices
- **Consistent patterns** - Accumulated knowledge of what works
- **Architectural governance** - Automatic enforcement of layer rules

## What Are They?

**Development assistants** that help YOU write code for the yt_autopilot project.

They are NOT runtime components of the YouTube automation system.
